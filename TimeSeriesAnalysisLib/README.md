# Time Series Analysis Library

## 🕒 What is Time Series Analysis?

**Time Series Analysis** is the process of analyzing data points that are collected or recorded at **regular intervals over time**.

Unlike standard datasets, time series data has an **inherent order**:
**Time matters.** You can't shuffle it!

## 📦 Examples of Time Series Data

| Domain       | Time Series Example                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| IoT/Embedded | Temperature readings every second     |
| Finance      | Daily stock prices                    |
| Weather      | Hourly humidity and pressure readings |
| Industry     | Machine vibration levels every 10 ms  |
| Healthcare   | Heart rate over time                  |

## 🎯 Goals of Time Series Analysis

| Goal                     | Example                               |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| 📈 Trend Detection       | Is temperature rising over days?      |
| 🔁 Seasonality Detection | Do energy usages spike every evening? |
| 📉 Forecasting           | Predict next week’s stock price       |
| 🛑 Anomaly Detection     | Detect sensor drift or failure        |
| 🧠 Pattern Recognition   | Learn recurring behaviors in system   |

## 📊 Components of a Time Series

1. **Trend**: Long-term increase/decrease
2. **Seasonality**: Regular repeating cycles (e.g., daily/weekly)
3. **Noise**: Random irregular variation
4. **Cyclic**: Irregular fluctuations (not fixed like seasonality)

## 🔍 Techniques in Time Series Analysis

| Method                                               | Purpose                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Moving Average**                                   | Smooth out short-term fluctuations      |
| **Exponential Smoothing**                            | Give more weight to recent values       |
| **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** | Model + Forecast complex patterns       |
| **Fourier Transform**                                | Identify repeating frequency components |
| **Seasonal Decomposition (STL)**                     | Break down trend/seasonality/noise      |
| **LSTM / RNN** (Deep Learning)                       | Learn temporal patterns for prediction  |

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

| Language | Libraries                                                                              |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Python   | `pandas`, `statsmodels`, `prophet`, `tsfresh`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `sktime`  |
| R        | `forecast`, `tseries`, `zoo`, `xts`                                                    |
| C++      | Less common, but doable using libraries like `Armadillo`, `Eigen`, or export to Python |

## 📈 Example Use Case: Predict Temperature

### Dataset:

- Timestamps (e.g., every minute)
- Temperature sensor readings

### Tasks:

1. Plot raw data (line graph)
2. Apply moving average to smooth noise
3. Decompose into trend + seasonality + residuals
4. Fit an ARIMA model
5. Forecast next 24 hours of data
