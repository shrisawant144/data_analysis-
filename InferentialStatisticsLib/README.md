# Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics is the branch of statistics that allows you to:

> 🔍 **Make conclusions or predictions about a population** based on a **sample of data**.

Where **descriptive statistics** summarizes what you _see_ in your dataset,
**inferential statistics** helps you make **educated guesses** about the **bigger picture** — i.e., the population the data came from.

## ✅ Simple Analogy:

> Imagine tasting a spoonful of soup to decide if the whole pot needs more salt.
> The spoon = sample, the pot = population → that's inferential statistics!

## 🧠 Key Goals of Inferential Statistics:

| Goal                | Description                                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🔮 Estimate         | Predict population parameters (e.g., mean, proportion) |
| 📊 Test Hypotheses  | Check if a belief about the population is likely true  |
| 🆚 Compare Groups   | See if two or more groups differ significantly         |
| 📈 Make Predictions | Forecast future outcomes based on current data         |

## 📚 Common Techniques in Inferential Statistics:

| Technique                | Purpose                                                         |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hypothesis Testing**   | Determine if a result is statistically significant              |
| **Confidence Intervals** | Estimate the range in which a population parameter likely falls |
| **T-tests / Z-tests**    | Compare means of two groups                                     |
| **Chi-square tests**     | Compare categorical data (e.g., surveys, counts)                |
| **ANOVA**                | Compare means across 3+ groups                                  |
| **Linear Regression**    | Predict outcomes, show relationships between variables          |
| **Correlation Analysis** | Measure the strength/direction of a relationship                |

## 🧪 Example:

**Problem**: A factory wants to know if the average weight of its bolts is 10g.

- It collects a **sample of 100 bolts**
- Finds a sample mean of **10.3g**
- Uses a **t-test** to determine if this difference is statistically significant

✅ **Inferential statistics** helps decide:
"Is this just random variation, or is something off in production?"

## 🧠 Summary Table

| Descriptive Statistics      | Inferential Statistics                   |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Describes the data you have | Makes predictions or decisions           |
| No generalization           | Generalizes from sample to population    |
| Examples: Mean, Median      | Examples: Hypothesis tests, CI, p-values |
| No uncertainty measured     | Includes margin of error, confidence     |
