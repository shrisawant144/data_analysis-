# Multivariate Statistics Library

## What is Multivariate Statistics?

Multivariate statistics is the branch of statistics that deals with the simultaneous analysis of more than two variables.

It helps answer questions like:

- How are multiple variables related to each other?
- Can we reduce the dimensionality of the data?
- Can we model and predict one variable using several others?

## Example Scenario

Imagine a dataset from an IoT weather station, with variables:

- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind speed
- Air pressure
- Light intensity

You wouldn’t analyze each variable alone — you’d want to understand how they all interact together.

## Why Use Multivariate Statistics?

| Goal                     | Example                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Understand relationships | How does humidity change with temperature and pressure? |
| Reduce dimensionality    | Compress sensor data using **PCA**                      |
| Build prediction models  | Predict air quality using multiple inputs               |
| Detect hidden structure  | Cluster similar sensor profiles                         |

## Common Techniques in Multivariate Statistics

| Method                                 | Purpose                                                 |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Correlation Matrix**                 | Measure linear relationships between variables          |
| **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** | Reduce the number of features while keeping variance    |
| **Factor Analysis**                    | Discover latent variables or hidden factors             |
| **Multivariate Regression**            | Predict one variable from several predictors            |
| **MANOVA**                             | Compare group means across multiple dependent variables |
| **Cluster Analysis (e.g., K-Means)**   | Group similar observations based on multiple features   |
| **Canonical Correlation**              | Find relationships between two sets of variables        |

## Visualization Tools

| Plot Type                 | Use Case                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Pair Plot**             | Visualize pairwise relationships      |
| **Heatmap (correlation)** | View variable correlation strengths   |
| **3D Scatter Plots**      | Plot three variables together         |
| **PCA Biplot**            | Visualize high-dimensional data in 2D |

## Tools for Multivariate Analysis

| Language | Libraries                                                                         |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Python   | `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `seaborn`, `statsmodels`                       |
| R        | `psych`, `FactoMineR`, `ggplot2`, `caret`                                         |
| C++      | Use with libraries like Armadillo, Eigen, or export data for analysis in Python/R |

## Example Use Case

### Predicting Air Quality from Multiple Inputs:

**Inputs (X)**:

- Temperature
- Humidity
- CO₂ level
- PM2.5

**Target (Y)**:

- Air Quality Index (AQI)

Use:

- **Multivariate regression** to predict AQI
- **PCA** to compress sensor inputs into fewer synthetic features
- **Clustering** to identify abnormal sensor behavior

| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Focus       | Analysis involving **multiple variables**     |
| Key Benefit | Understand complex patterns and reduce noise  |
| Related to  | Machine learning, data reduction, modeling    |
| Output      | Trends, predictions, groups, latent variables |
