## What Is Regression Analysis?

Regression analysis helps you **understand how one or more independent variables** (inputs) affect a **dependent variable** (output).

## Why Is Regression Analysis Used?

| Purpose                           | Description                                             |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **Prediction**                 | Estimate future values (e.g., house price, temperature) |
| ✅ **Trend modeling**             | Show how variables change together over time            |
| ✅ **Relationship strength**      | Quantify how strong the connection is between variables |
| ✅ **Causal inference (limited)** | Determine if X might cause changes in Y                 |
| ✅ **Forecasting**                | Project future data trends (sales, stock prices, etc.)  |

## Simple Example: House Price Prediction

Suppose you're analyzing how house price (`price`) depends on:

- size in square feet (`size`)
- number of rooms (`rooms`)

Using regression, you might find:

```
price = 50000 + 200 * size + 10000 * rooms
```

This equation lets you **predict** the house price based on size and rooms.

## Types of Regression

| Type                      | When to Use                                                    |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Linear Regression**     | Relationship is linear (straight-line fit)                     |
| **Multiple Regression**   | Multiple inputs (e.g., age, weight, gender)                    |
| **Polynomial Regression** | Data has curvature, not straight line                          |
| **Logistic Regression**   | Predict binary outcome (e.g., yes/no, spam/not)                |
| **Ridge/Lasso**           | Linear regression with regularization (to prevent overfitting) |

## Real-Life Use Cases

| Field        | Use Case                                 |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Business     | Predicting sales, customer behavior      |
| Embedded/IoT | Predicting sensor drift, system load     |
| Agriculture  | Predicting yield based on soil/weather   |
| Healthcare   | Estimating risk based on patient metrics |
| Finance      | Forecasting stock prices or revenue      |

## Summary

| Feature     | Description                                   |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Goal        | Model/predict relationships between variables |
| Input       | Independent variable(s) (X)                   |
| Output      | Dependent variable (Y)                        |
| Output form | Equation or model                             |
| Example     | `Y = a + bX` (simple linear regression)       |
