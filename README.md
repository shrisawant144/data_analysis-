# Discriptive_Analysis Repository

## Overview

This repository is a comprehensive collection of C++ libraries focused on various statistical and data analysis techniques. It is designed to provide practical tools and implementations for analyzing data in different domains such as sensor data, finance, healthcare, IoT, and more. Each library targets a specific area of statistical analysis, offering both foundational and advanced methods.

## Libraries Included

### 1. DescriptiveStatisticsLib

Provides fundamental descriptive statistics functions to summarize and understand raw data. Use cases include sensor behavior summaries, system performance baselines, anomaly detection, batch quality analysis, user behavior patterns, test summary reports, and time-based rollups.

### 2. ExploratoryDataAnalysisLib

Focuses on the process of visually and statistically exploring datasets to understand their structure, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and form hypotheses. Includes common EDA techniques such as summary statistics, visualizations, missing value analysis, and outlier detection.

### 3. InferentialStatisticsLib

Enables making conclusions or predictions about a population based on sample data. Implements key inferential statistics techniques like hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, t-tests, chi-square tests, ANOVA, linear regression, and correlation analysis.

### 4. MultivariateStatisticsLib

Deals with the simultaneous analysis of multiple variables to understand relationships, reduce dimensionality, build prediction models, and detect hidden structures. Implements methods such as PCA, factor analysis, clustering, and multivariate regression.

### 5. ProbabilityDistributionsLib

Provides implementations of common probability distributions, both discrete and continuous, including Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson, Normal (Gaussian), Uniform, and Exponential distributions. Useful for modeling randomness, making predictions, running simulations, and hypothesis testing.

### 6. RegressionAnalysisLib

Offers tools for modeling and predicting relationships between independent and dependent variables. Supports various regression types including linear, multiple, polynomial, logistic, and regularized regression. Applicable in business, embedded systems, agriculture, healthcare, and finance.

### 7. TimeSeriesAnalysisLib

Focuses on analyzing data collected over time, emphasizing the importance of temporal order. Implements techniques for trend detection, seasonality analysis, forecasting, anomaly detection, and pattern recognition. Includes moving averages, exponential smoothing, ARIMA, and Fourier transforms.

## Getting Started

Each library contains example code in its respective `main.cpp` file demonstrating usage of the implemented techniques. The libraries are designed to be modular and can be used independently or combined for comprehensive data analysis workflows.

## Contributions and Extensions

The repository is open for contributions and can be extended with additional statistical methods, visualization tools, and language bindings. Suggestions and pull requests are welcome.
